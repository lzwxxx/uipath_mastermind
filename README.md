**Use Case:**<br />
* You would like to show-off your robot building skills by building a simple game<br />
* You’ve picked a logic game based off an old code-breaking game called Cows and Bulls, also widely known as Mastermind<br /><br />

**Your robot should perform the following:**<br />
1. Generate a 4-digit random number sequence i.e.0000 to 9999<br />
2. Explain the rules of the game to the user<br />
3. The user has 10 tries in guessing the number<br />
4. For each guess, provide the response as follows:<br />
    * User’s guess, 1N for correct number in wrong position, 1P for each correct number in correct position
5. If the user guesses the correct number within 10 tries, display “You’ve won! The number was xxxx.”<br />
6. If the user is unable to guess the correct number within 10 tries, display “Game Over! The number was xxxx.”<br />
